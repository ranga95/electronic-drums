# electronic-drums / Arduino Beat Trigger 
This software produces the music sound in the data folder when ever the serial input is 1 and it will stop when even times 1 is inputed.
You can connect the peizo or any other sensor to the arduino and code the arduino to serial print 1 for the sensor inputs.

This is created for the music triggering of my friend-Pakston.

This can be used not only for the electronic drums also to make any work done from the input of the arduino to computer - for any projects regarding message me I will help you out
